You could also have used the function `head()` to show the first 6 rows of the dataframe or could have viewed the data by clicking manually on `MM_data` in the `Global Environment`. 

Watch out, though!!! `head(`) can be a bit misleading in that it creates a new tibble and the output reads `# A tibble: 6 x 7`. This does not mean that our `MM_data` only has 6 rows of observations!!!

Viewing the data opens the data in a new tab in the `Source pane` but it does not show you the data types of the columns. You could, however, click on the wee blue arrow next to the data name.
